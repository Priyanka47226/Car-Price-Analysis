## 🚗 Car Price Analysis
## OVERVIEW
This project focuses on analyzing a real-world car dataset to understand how various factors influence the selling price of used cars. The dataset captures both technical and market-related features such as fuel type, transmission, ownership history, and distance driven. The goal of this analysis is to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships that can help in price estimation and decision-making.

Rather than treating car prices as standalone values, this project studies how depreciation, usage, and specifications collectively impact resale value.
## DATASET
The dataset contains 301 records, where each row represents a unique car entry. It includes information related to car identity, usage, and pricing.

🔹 Columns Description

Car_Name – Name/model of the car

Year – Manufacturing year of the vehicle

Selling_Price – Price at which the car is being sold (in lakhs)

Present_Price – Current showroom price of the car (in lakhs)

Kms_Driven – Total distance driven by the car (in kilometers)

Fuel_Type – Type of fuel used (Petrol / Diesel / CNG)

Seller_Type – Type of seller (Dealer or Individual)

Transmission – Gear type (Manual or Automatic)

Owner – Number of previous owners
## INSIGHTS
* Distribution of selling prices across different fuel types.

* Comparison between manual and automatic transmission prices.

* Relationship between kilometers driven and selling price.

* Effect of car age on depreciation.
## KEY INSIGHTS

* Cars with lower kilometers driven generally have a higher selling price

* Diesel cars tend to retain value better compared to petrol cars

* Automatic transmission vehicles are priced higher on average

* As the age of the car increases, the selling price decreases significantly

* Cars sold by dealers usually have higher prices than those sold by individuals
## CONCLUSION
This project highlights how multiple factors collectively influence the resale value of cars. By performing structured exploratory data analysis, we can clearly see the effects of depreciation, usage, and car specifications on pricing.

The insights from this analysis can be useful for buyers, sellers, and businesses looking to make data-driven pricing decisions.
